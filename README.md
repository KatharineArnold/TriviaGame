This is a dog breed trivia game that shows only one question until the player answers it or their time runs out.
If the player selects the correct answer, a screen congratulating them for choosing the right option displays. After a few seconds, the next question will display without user input.

If the player runs out of time, time's up and the correct answer will display. If the player chooses the wrong answer, the correct answer will be displayed.


On the final screen, the number of correct answers, and incorrect answers will display, and an option to restart the game (without reloading the page).
